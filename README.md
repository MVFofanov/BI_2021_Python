# Integration of the ADASTRA database as a novel annotator module in the OpenCRAVAT pipeline

The ADASTRA database contains information about allele-specific transcription factor binding events. A Transcription Factor (TF) might prefer to bind one of two alternative alleles of homologous chromosomes and thus exhibit allele-specific binding (ASB). ASB highlights regulatory SNPs with high potential to affect gene expression.

## Background Allelic Dosage

Background Allelic Dosage (BAD) is the expected ratio of major to minor allelic frequencies in a particular genomic region. For example, if a copy number of two alternating alleles is the same (e.g. 1:1 (diploid), 2:2, or 3:3), then the respective region has BAD=1, i.e. the expected ratio of reads mapped to alternative alleles on heterozygous SNVs is 1. All triploid regions have BAD=2 and the expected allelic read ratio is either 2 or Â½. In general, if BAD of a particular region is known, then the expected frequencies of allelic reads are 1/(BAD +1) and BAD/(BAD + 1).
ASB significance (FDR)

## ASB effect size

The Effect Size of an ASB event is calculated separately for Reference and Alternative alleles and is defined as the weighted mean of log-ratios of observed and expected allelic read counts, with weights being -log10 of the respective P-values.

## Motif Concordance

Motif Concordance indicates whether the allelic read imbalance is consistent with the transcription factor motif Fold Change (FC, predicted from sequence analysis). The following notation is used:

*  n/a: Motif is not available;
*  No hit: The best hit P-value is higher than 0.0005 threshold;
*  Weak concordant: The absolute value of FC is less than 2 but consistent with the allelic read imbalance;
*  Weak discordant: The absolute value of FC is less than 2 and not consistent with the allelic read imbalance;
*  Concordant: The absolute value of FC is greater or equal to 2 and consistent with allelic read imbalance;
*  Discordant: The absolute value of FC is greater or equal to 2 but not consistent with allelic read imbalance.

` ` `
cd oc_test/
` ` `

Creating a new virtual environment located at ./new_oc_env/

` ` `
python3 -m venv ./new_oc_env/
` ` `

Activating a new virtual environment

` ` `
source ./new_oc_env/bin/activate
` ` `
